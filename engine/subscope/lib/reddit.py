  - canonical_url(post_data)                    : URL normalization
  - parse_post(child)                           : normalize a JSON listing entry
  - parse_atom_entry(entry)                     : normalize an Atom <entry>
  - fetch_json(url)                             : raw public GET with retry
  - fetch_xml(url)                              : single-URL RSS/Atom GET with retry
  - fetch_xml_resilient(path)                   : dual-host RSS GET (www, then old.reddit)
  - _safe_username(username)                    : path-injection guard

Why RSS, not JSON: as of 2026-05-29 Reddit's edge (Fastly/Varnish) returns an
instant `403 Blocked` (Retry-After: 0) for every unauthenticated `.json`
endpoint, www and old reddit alike, regardless of User-Agent. The machine IP is
fine (HTML + RSS both return 200). The RSS/Atom surface
(`/r/<sub>/new/.rss`, `/user/<x>/comments/.rss`) still returns 200 with no
credentials, so the fetcher reads those instead.

Header discipline (2026-06-01): RSS GETs send a User-Agent and NOTHING ELSE. The
edge began 403ing any keyless RSS request that carries an explicit `Accept`
header from a non-browser TLS client (any value, including `*/*`); the identical
URL with UA-only returns 200. The trigger is the header's presence, not its
value, so the fetcher omits Accept entirely. This is a deterministic fingerprint
block, not a transient: a request with Accept fails on every retry. See
_fetch_xml_attempt and test_reddit_no_accept_header. For resilience the fetcher
fails over across two RSS hosts (www.reddit.com, then old.reddit.com) on a
403/5xx/network error, but never on a 429 (the rate-limit bucket is per-IP and
shared across hosts). See fetch_xml_resilient + RSS_HOSTS. No HTML scrape, no
auth host, ever.

OAuth was removed in v0.2 and stays removed. The product positions on
"Free, no API keys"; reintroducing OAuth is explicitly out of scope.

RSS does NOT carry score, num_comments, upvote_ratio, or locked state. Those
fields default (score=0, num_comments=0, upvote_ratio=None, locked=False) and
the scorer degrades gracefully (see score.py). `/user/<x>/about.json` (karma +
age) is also 403, so fetch_user_about returns None and author_vet fails open.

# Rate-limit discipline. Reddit's keyless RSS surface enforces a per-IP token
# bucket (~100 req / 10 min, surfaced via x-ratelimit-* headers). A daily manual
# run fires ~18 sub feeds plus an author comments feed per plausible OP, which
# will trip the limit if we burst. We pace requests instead.
#
# MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL: minimum wall-clock gap between ANY two Reddit GETs. A
#   once or twice daily run can afford ~30 to 60s of total spacing.
# RATELIMIT_REMAINING_FLOOR: when a response says this few tokens remain, pause
#   until the bucket resets rather than bursting into a 429.
# MAX_RATELIMIT_PAUSE: hard cap on any single ratelimit/Retry-After sleep, so a

# per IP, shared across www and old.reddit (verified: a second GET to either
# host inside the window is a hard 429). Every 200 therefore reports
# `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0` / `used: 1`, which is NOT a fault, it is the
# steady state. Two consequences drive the design below:
#
#  1. remaining=0 on a 200 must never be treated as a terminal "drained" state.
#     The pause until reset IS the remedy; after it the bucket has refilled.
#     Only a 429 that survives every retry is a real stop signal.
#  2. One request per minute makes per-sub feeds unaffordable (a 10-sub run
#     would idle for 10 minutes). Subs are batched into combined
#     /r/a+b+c/new/.rss feeds, which Reddit serves in a SINGLE request with

#   quiet one out of the shared 100-entry page.
# DEFAULT_REQUEST_BUDGET: hard ceiling on Reddit GETs per run. At ~1 request
#   per minute this is also the run's worst-case wall-clock in minutes, so it

    The first <entry> in a comments feed is the submission (id 't3_...');
    comment entries ('t1_...') are dropped by parse_atom_entry's id guard. We
    select by id-match rather than position, so a feed that lists a comment
    before the submission still returns the submission, never a comment.

    Returns the normalized post dict (same shape as parse_atom_entry), or None
    when: the id cannot be extracted/validated (no network call is made), the
    feed is unreachable or rate-limited, or the feed carries no submission entry
    matching the id. Callers cannot distinguish unreachable from removed/empty
    (both map to None); for the judge skill that is enough (reach, or fall back
    to a pasted title+body).

    This is the keyless replacement for the dead fetch_json single-post path.
