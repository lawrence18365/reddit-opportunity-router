"""subscope CLI. Python-side does fetch + gate + score + SQLite.

Claude (chat session) is the outer orchestrator per stress-test outcome #1:
- Claude calls Playwright MCP for blog refresh (rarely; only on Dan's signal),
  then passes any new blog post via `blog ingest`.
- Claude invokes `fetch-score`; receives JSON of surfaces.
- Claude calls Notion MCP to sync the daily board.

This script does NOT call any MCP tools. Stdlib + pyyaml only.

Subcommands:
  setup          Bootstrap SQLite, seed configs from YAML
  fetch-score    Fetch deltas, gate, score, mark surfaced, print JSON to stdout
  status         Print last-run summary as JSON
  blog ingest    Upsert blog post(s) from stdin JSON
